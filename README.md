# üè• Medical AI Intake Agent (OpenMic Integration)

 This project is about a **Medical Intake Agent** built with **React (frontend)** and **Node.js/Express (backend)** using the **OpenMic API**.  

The agent simulates patient intake calls:  
- Introduces itself  
- Requests a patient‚Äôs Medical ID or name  
- Fetches patient details dynamically via a **Function Call API**  
- Uses **Pre-call**, **Function call**, and **Post-call webhooks** for data flow  
- Logs transcripts and metadata in the UI
